**Portfolio Strategy Development**
=====================================

### Allocation Strategy

Based on the investment analysis, we recommend a weighted allocation of 60% to TCS and 40% to its peers (Infosys, Wipro, and HCL Technologies) in the portfolio.

*   **TCS:** Long-term investors can benefit from TCS's strong financial performance and CEO compensation. We allocate 60% of the portfolio to TCS.
*   **Peers:** To diversify the portfolio, we allocate 40% among Infosys, Wipro, and HCL Technologies, with a focus on Infosys as its top pick.

### Risk Management

To manage risk, we recommend:

*   **Diversification:** Spread investments across industries (IT services, consulting, and other) to minimize exposure to sector-specific risks.
*   **Risk-based asset allocation:** Allocate 20% of the portfolio to low-risk assets (e.g., government bonds) and 30% to moderate-risk assets (e.g., large-cap stocks).

### Investment Timeframes

Based on our analysis, we recommend:

*   **Long-term investors:** Invest for at least 5 years to capture TCS's growth potential.
*   **Short-term investors:** Consider a shorter investment timeframe (1-3 years) for peers like Infosys and Wipro, as they may offer more volatile returns.

### Diversification Strategy

To diversify the portfolio, we recommend:

*   **Sector rotation:** Rotate investments across sectors (e.g., IT services, consulting, healthcare) to minimize exposure to sector-specific risks.
*   **Geographic diversification:** Invest in companies with a presence in multiple geographies to spread risk.

### Performance Monitoring and Rebalancing

Regularly monitor portfolio performance and rebalance the allocation as needed to maintain the target asset allocation.
